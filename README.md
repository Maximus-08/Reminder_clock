Clock Countdown & Real Available Time Calculator
This project is a web-based countdown timer that not only tracks the time remaining until a target date, but also calculates your real available time for focused work, after accounting for daily activities like sleep, chores, travel, work, and miscellaneous tasks.

Features
Visual Countdown: Displays time remaining in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Progress Arcs: Animated circular progress arcs for each time unit.
Daily Activity Inputs: Enter your average daily hours for sleep, chores, travel, work, and miscellaneous activities.
Real Available Time: Calculates and displays how much of your countdown is actually available for focused work.
Warnings: Alerts you if your daily committed hours exceed 24.
Responsive UI: Clean and interactive interface.
How It Works
Set a Target Date:
Use the date/time picker to select your countdown target.

Enter Daily Activities:
Fill in the number of hours you spend daily on sleep, chores, travel, work, and miscellaneous tasks.

Start Countdown:
Click the "Start" button. The app will display:

The countdown to your target date.
Your total daily committed and available hours.
The total countdown time and your real available time for focused work.
The percentage of your countdown that is truly available.
Usage
Open index.html in your browser.
Adjust the target date and daily activity hours as needed.
Review your available time and plan accordingly!
File Structure
index.html: Main HTML file for the app UI.
